                    <p>The Tata DoCoMo Photon Max Wi-Fi Duo has a name that's almost too long to keep track of, but it's also the most useful 
                        personal Wi-Fi hotspot we've used. The Duo has a built-in battery so you can charge it up at home and then use it to 
                        connect your devices to the Internet on the move. The cool part is that it also has a standard USB port, and this can 
                        be used to recharge your phone. It was launched in December for Rs. 2,899 and we used one for a couple of weeks.The 
                        design of the Duo is pretty basic, but it gets the job done. It's a small, palm-sized brick that will fit into even 
                        a small bag. If you want, you could even keep it in your pocket, though that might get a little uncomfortable to walk 
                        around. The ports are on the sides, and on top, there is a row of five lights, that show you the battery and network 
                        levels, whether the Wi-Fi or charge functions are in use, and if there is any SMS for you (which you can check via 
                        the desktop software). Thankfully, the Duo itself is charged using a standard Micro-USB cable, the same that most 
                        non-Apple phones have, which means you don't need to keep another cable with you.
