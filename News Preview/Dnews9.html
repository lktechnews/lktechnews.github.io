                    <p>Many companies bury or gloss over parts of announcements that are likely to invite criticism, but Apple specifically highlighted 
                        its decision to stop bundling chargers with its latest Apple Watch models when they were announced on Tuesday. The news was 
                        framed as part of the company's moves towards sustainability and eco-friendly packaging, and sure, those goals will be furthered 
                        by dropping bundled chargers. But does this argument hold up, or is it just cynical stinginess by a giant corporation? Let's just 
                        be clear right at the outset – very few companies include mains adapters with small gadgets, including wearables. These typically 
                        have small batteries and charge quickly, or can be left somewhere overnight and don't need to be used urgently. Plenty of headphones, 
                        fitness trackers, speakers, household accessories, toys, and even small appliances use Micro-USB or USB Type-C ports for charging, 
                        specifically so that buyers can use the chargers they already have.Do we need new chargers with every new product we buy? For many 
                        of us, the answer is no. I have the boxes that my last two iPhones came in – purchased in 2019 and 2017 – and both bundled chargers 
                        are still lying inside, untouched. I simply didn't need to take them out when I already had four or five in use. I have at least one 
                        by my bedside, at my desk, and in my bag already, with another few ready to grab whenever needed. I don't need an individual charger 
                        for each device.That said, I wouldn't be happy if I couldn't use a brand new Apple Watch just because I don't have something to plug 
                        it into. Apple's current PCs all have USB Type-C ports and most of my chargers are Type-A. I might be covered, but I can imagine that 
                        others wouldn't be. PCs and laptops also typically allow relatively low power draw through their USB ports which might be fine for a 
                        watch but would quickly become frustrating and impractical for a phone or tablet. It's worth noting that the new iPads announced at 
                        the same event do still ship with chargers.
